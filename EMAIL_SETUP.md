# Email Setup Guide for VOI Cockpit - Leadership Portal

## ðŸŽ‰ Current Status: WORKING!

The email system is now working perfectly! Here's what happens:

### âœ… Development Mode (Current Setup)
- **Emails are logged to the console** instead of being sent
- **Registration works perfectly** - users get the "check your email" message
- **Email verification URLs are displayed in the terminal** for testing
- **No Gmail setup required** for development

### ðŸ“§ How to See Verification Links

When you register a new account, check your **terminal/console** where the server is running. You'll see output like:

```
ðŸ“§ VERIFICATION EMAIL (Development Mode):
To: test@example.com
Subject: Verify your email address - VOI Cockpit
Verification URL: http://localhost:3000/auth/verify-email?token=abc123...
---
```

**Copy and paste that URL into your browser** to verify the email!

## ðŸš€ For Production: Setting Up Real Email Service

If you want to send real emails (for production), follow these steps:

### Option 1: Gmail SMTP (Recommended)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Google account
2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" and your device
   - Copy the 16-character password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

3. **Update your `.env.local` file**:
   ```bash
   # Email Service Configuration
   SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
   SMTP_PORT="587"
   SMTP_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
   SMTP_PASSWORD="your-16-character-app-password"
   ```

4. **Restart your server** after updating the environment variables

### Option 2: Other Email Services

#### SendGrid
```bash
SMTP_HOST="smtp.sendgrid.net"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER="apikey"
SMTP_PASSWORD="your-sendgrid-api-key"
```

#### Mailgun
```bash
SMTP_HOST="smtp.mailgun.org"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER="your-mailgun-smtp-username"
SMTP_PASSWORD="your-mailgun-smtp-password"
```

#### AWS SES
```bash
SMTP_HOST="email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER="your-ses-smtp-username"
SMTP_PASSWORD="your-ses-smtp-password"
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Email not received"

- For Gmail: Use App Password, not your regular password
- Ensure 2-Factor Authentication is enabled
- Check that SMTP credentials are correct

### Problem: "Registration fails"
